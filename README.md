# Social Media Learning Project

This is a learning project built to understand and implement modern web development concepts using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Supabase. It's a social media platform that demonstrates various features commonly found in modern web applications.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React (with Vite)
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend:**
  - Supabase (Backend as a Service)
  - Real-time database
  - Authentication
  - File storage

## ✨ Features

- User authentication with GitHub
- Create and share posts
- Upload images
- Like and comment on posts
- Real-time updates
- Responsive design
- Modern UI with glassmorphism effects

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git
- A Supabase account (free tier works fine)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
2. Add the following variables:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

To get these values:
1. Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Project Settings -> API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key
4. Paste them in your `.env` file

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173/social-media-vite-supabase`
